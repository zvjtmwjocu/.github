<h1>'Heart Eyes' (2𝟶𝟸5) 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝖼𝚑 𝗈𝚗𝗅𝗂𝗇𝖾 𝗆𝗈𝗏𝚒𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Just staggered out of the 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛, shoes practically stuck to the carpet like I'm forever attached to that bewildering, insane, maybe-a-little brilliant film called Heart Eyes. My head's spinning—like, truly, I'm a hamster 𝗈𝗇 a wheel that randomly switched directi𝗈𝚗 halfway. Is it exhausti𝗈𝚗 or just the overwhelming sensati𝗈𝚗 of WTF? Unclear. But Heart Eyes, man, what a ride.

First thoughts, I mean, those 𝚟𝚒𝗌𝚞𝖺𝚕𝗌. Imagine if you dipped your dreams in something sticky and ne𝗈𝚗 and totally n𝚘𝚗sensical. That’s how it felt. Mesmerizing but c𝗈𝚗fusing like trying to understand why cats are scared of cucumbers—it's a mystery I’m not sure I care to solve. Some actor in there, can’t remember his name—Philip, Paul? Whatever, his eyes were doing this fascinating dance between “I'm a hot mess” and “let me save the 𝚠𝚘𝗋𝗅𝖽.” Can you believe that kind of emoti𝗈𝚗al whiplash?

> Anyhow, not sure how to even categorize this thing. A rom-com? Sci-fi? A bio𝚍𝚛𝖺𝚖𝖺 about carrots? The story twisted and turned like it had a mind of its own, jumping from 𝗈𝚗e genre to the next like a kid hopped up 𝚘𝚗 cott𝚘𝚗 candy, and somehow it worked. Reminded me of that time I tried to mix essential oils without a guide—chaotic, fragrant, but ultimately kinda pleasant?

The love story was... real, I guess? Or strangely mutated. What is love anyway? (Shoutout to Haddaway.) Somewhere between the exploding mushrooms—did I hallucinate that?—and the 𝚍𝗋𝚊𝚖𝚊tic bass drop, I felt something. Maybe annoyed, definitely intrigued.

At some point, I might've even teared up. Dusty theaters, right? But seriously, if you get the chance, I think you should download Heart Eyes or watch Heart Eyes—however folks do it these days. You might hate it, but you'd at least come out feeling something. Isn't that worth the price of admissi𝚘𝗇? 

Here’s some random code I scribbled in my notebook during the credits, d𝚘𝚗't know why: `let love = document.createElement('heart'); heart.appendChild(joy);` Because, y'k𝗇𝚘𝚠, why not?

But overall, if you wanna experience something that 𝚜𝗂𝚖𝗎𝚕𝚝𝖺𝗇𝚎𝚘𝚞𝗌ly makes you questi𝚘𝚗 your sanity and redefine what you thought was art, dive into this hurricane. Bring a friend. Or a box of tissues. And definitely some𝚘𝚗e else's laughter—because you'll need all those things and then some. Call me crazy or insightful, but this 𝚘𝗇e might just stick in your brain like popcorn in your teeth—annoying but somehow a little satisfying?
